We chose to use a map of tags to text inside Events class. We know this is memory intensive, but as per our TA's instructions, a specific tag search requires this map. 
You can see the old version (that used a HashSet of tags, and was less memory intensive) that filtered tags but not tags with keywords simultaneously in the history.
